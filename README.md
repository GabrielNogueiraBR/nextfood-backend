## Local Setup

### Requirements
1. Make sure **Node JS** is installed on your machine by running:
```bash
node -v
```

2. If you have not installed the **Node JS**, use the following link to download 16.x version and install it: [Download NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

1\. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/GabrielNogueiraBR/nextfood-backend) 
`git clone https://github.com/GabrielNogueiraBR/Monext.git`

2\. Copy `.env.schema` as `.env` and adjust environment variables according to instructions provided on itself.

3\. Install `pnpm` package manager:

```sh
npm i -g pnpm
```

4\. Install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm i
```

The advantage of using `.env` methodology is being able to locally boot a containerized version of your application without further configurations.

5\. If everything was properly set up, you may run the application either with live reload or containerized:

**Live Reload**

```sh
pnpm dev
```

**Containerized**

```sh
pnpm docker
```

6\. To ensure application is running correctly navigate to health check APP:

http://127.0.0.1:8080/


### Testing

Tests are based on [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) framework and its typings for development should be automatically recognized after installing project dependencies. 

Test files are recognized for processing through the `*.spec.ts` pattern. By default they should be created at the same directory of its implementation counterpart.

To run tests execute the built-in script:

```sh
pnpm test
```

### Debugging

Application is configured to expose Node.js debug socket when being boot through live reload.

Which means you may attach a debugger at target port in order to enable code breakpoints.

Configuration is already done fo VSCode users which may simply start debugging by running:

```sh
pnpm dev
[press F5]
```

### Linting

This repository is configured with linting rules.

It is recommended to configure your IDE to automatically apply auto-fixes. Details on how to do so for IntelliJ, VSCode, Sublime Text and Atom are available at the following article:

[Even faster code formatting using ESLint](https://medium.com/@netczuk/even-faster-code-formatting-using-eslint-22b80d061461)

You may use a built-in NPM script to run a full lint check and print execution report:

```sh
pnpm lint
```

### Committing

Commit messages follows conventions of [@commitlint/config-conventional](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commitlint/config-conventional), which in short accepts one of its `types` followed by a scope (optional) and a description.

**Types**

```sh
build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test
```

**Examples**

```sh
feat(user): add user manipulation
fix: JSON parsing exception
chore(auth): change member accessibility
ci: fix wrong build definition
```
