# Nextfood BE

This project contains the Nextfood application backend.

## Local Setup

1\. Copy `.env.schema` as `.env` and adjust environment variables according to instructions provided on itself.

2\. Install `pnpm` package manager:

```sh
npm i -g pnpm
```

3\. Install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm i
```

The advantage of using `.env` methodology is being able to locally boot a containerized version of your application without further configurations.

4\. If everything was properly set up, you may run the application either with live reload or containerized:

**Live Reload**

```sh
pnpm dev
```

**Containerized**

```sh
pnpm docker
```

5\. To ensure application is running correctly navigate to health check APP:

### Testing

Tests are based on [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) framework and its typings for development should be automatically recognized after installing project dependencies. 

Test files are recognized for processing through the `*.spec.ts` pattern. By default they should be created at the same directory of its implementation counterpart.

To run tests execute the built-in script:

```sh
pnpm test
```

### Debugging

Application is configured to expose Node.js debug socket when being boot through live reload.

Which means you may attach a debugger at target port in order to enable code breakpoints.

Configuration is already done fo VSCode users which may simply start debugging by running:

```sh
pnpm dev
[press F5]
```


### Linting

This repository is configured with linting rules.

It is recommended to configure your IDE to automatically apply auto-fixes. Details on how to do so for IntelliJ, VSCode, Sublime Text and Atom are available at the following article:

[Even faster code formatting using ESLint](https://medium.com/@netczuk/even-faster-code-formatting-using-eslint-22b80d061461)

You may use a built-in NPM script to run a full lint check and print execution report:

```sh
pnpm lint
```
